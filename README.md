# About First of the month
## Problem
There is a INI file with a list of names, displayed as shown bellow:
[A,B,B,D,C,Z,A,B]

## Solution
Deliver a TXT file with the next name "firsts_from_MONTH_YEAR".
This file will contain a list of the names on it, and the times each name is repeated, sorting the number in descendent form in the process:
> B: 3
>
> A: 2
>
> D: 1
>
> C: 1
>
> Z: 1
